	oxide inverse opal thin films are presented. The photonic crystals
	examined are shown to have fcc structure with amount of stacking
	faults varying among the samples. The method used in this study makes
	it possible to easily distinguish between samples with predominantly
	twinned fcc structure and nearly perfect fcc stacking. The difference
	observed between samples fabricated under identical conditions is
	attributed to random layer stacking in the self-assembled colloidal
	crystals used as templates for fabricating the inverse opals. The
	present method provides a versatile tool for analyzing photonic crystal
	structure in studies of inverse opals made of various materials,
	colloidal crystals, and three-dimensional photonic crystals of other
	types.},

	opals and followed by the extraction of the SiO2 spheres by chemical

	was shifted from Tc&#xa0;=&#xa0;7.196&#xa0;K for bulk Pb to Tc&#xa0;=&#xa0;7.325&#xa0;K.
	The upper critical field Hc2 (3150&#xa0;Oe) measured from high-field
	hysteresis loops exceeds the critical field for bulk lead (803&#xa0;Oe)
	fourfold. Two well resolved peaks observed in the hysteresis loops
	were ascribed to flux penetration into the cylindrical void space
	that can be found in inverse opal structure and into the periodic
	structure of Pb nanoparticles. The red inverse opal shows pronounced
	oscillations of magnetic moment in the mixed state at low temperatures,
	T&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;5.5&#xa0;K. The shape of these oscillations and
	their temperature dependence indicate on phase transitions in the
	fluxoid state of Pb core. The weak matching effect in the field dependence
	of magneto-resistivity measurement at low magnetic fields and T&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.9Tc
	has been observed for all of the samples studied. The magnetic field
	periodicity of resistivity modulation is in good agreement with the

	failure to observe pronounced modulation in magneto-resistive measurement
	to difficulties in the precision orientation of the sample along
	the magnetic field.},

	a preferential direction in the (111) plane is observed when pumping

	spectrum and consists of several narrow lines located within the

	of two- or three-dimensional highly ordered macroporous cobalt{,}
	iron{,} nickel{,} and nickel iron alloy films containing close packed
	arrays of spherical holes of uniform size (an inverse opal structure).
	The films were prepared by electrochemical deposition from aqueous
	solution within the interstitial spaces of pre-assembled templates.
	The templates were assembled from colloidal polystyrene latex spheres
	(0.20{,} 0.50{,} 0.75 or 1.00 [small micro]m in diameter) assembled

	Scanning electron microscopy of the resulting films show well-formed
	two- or three-dimensional porous structures consisting of interconnected
	close packed arrays of spherical voids. X-Ray diffraction analysis
	confirms that the nickel iron alloy in the walls of the structure
	is polycrystalline fcc in structure with a grain size which is significantly
	smaller than the thickness of the walls. The diameter of the spherical
	voids within the structures can be varied by changing the diameter
	of the polystyrene latex spheres used to form the template. Studies
	of the magnetic properties of the macroporous films show a large
	coercivity enhancement in comparison to the corresponding plain films
	and we find that the coercive field gradually increases as the diameter
	of the spherical voids decreases for films of a constant thickness.},

	of these materials has now been extended to the oxides of iron, tungsten,
	and antimony, as well as a mixed yttrium-zirconium system and organically
	modi- fied silicates. These materials were characterized by Fourier-transform
	infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
	transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction
	(SAED), X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and powder X-ray
	diffraction (XRD). Ordered structures of iron, tungsten, and antimony
	were formed from alkoxide precursors as in the originally reported
	synthesis, but the template was removed at a lower temperature. Samples
	of vinyl- and 2-cyanoethyl-modified silicates were formed from a
	mixture of organotrialkoxysilane and tetraalkoxysilane precursors;
	the polystyrene template was removed by extraction with a THF/acetone
	mixture. These results show the ease of extending the original syn-
	thesis to a wide range of systems. Also, the ability to form homogenous
	mixed-metal oxides will be important for tailoring the dielectric
	and photonic properties of these materials. },

  abstract = {A frustrated system is one whose symmetry precludes the possibility
	that every pairwise interaction (‚Äúbond‚Äù) in the system can be
	satisfied at the same time. Such systems are common in all areas
	of physical and biological science. In the most extreme cases, they
	can have a disordered ground state with ‚Äúmacroscopic‚Äù degeneracy;
	that is, one that comprises a huge number of equivalent states of
	the same energy. Pauling's description of the low-temperature proton
	disorder in water ice was perhaps the first recognition of this phenomenon
	and remains the paradigm. In recent years, a new class of magnetic
	substance has been characterized, in which the disorder of the magnetic
	moments at low temperatures is precisely analogous to the proton
	disorder in water ice. These substances, known as spin ice materials,
	are perhaps the ‚Äúcleanest‚Äù examples of such highly frustrated

  abstract = {Abstract During the last decade the term ‚Ä?spin glass‚Äô has become
	prominent in the literature on magnetism. It refers to magnetic alloys
	where the spins on the impurities become locked or frozen into random
	orientations below a characteristic temperature T 0. In this article
	the properties of spin glasses are described with particular reference
	to the two archetypal examples AuFe and CuMn. Interest in spin glasses
	was mainly stimulated by some a.c. susceptibility measurements which
	showed sharp, cusp-like peaks, accurately defining T 0 and suggesting
	that some type of phase transition was occurring. The Mossbauer effect
	and the anomalous Hall effect also showed clear features at T 0 supporting
	this viewpoint. But measurements of the electrical resistivity and
	‚Ä?specific heat‚Äô, here usually meaning the molar heat capacity,
	also the remanence, magnetic hysteresis and time-dependent effects
	observed in spin glasses were difficult to reconcile with a phase
	transition approach. This article discusses the results obtained
	from the very wide variety of experimental techniques which have
	been used to investigate spin glasses, and also deals with some of
	the important theoretical concepts which have arisen out of these
	studies. Then follows a short account of the many systems which have
	been found to exhibit spin glass behaviour and which suggest that
	it is a widespread magnetic state of matter. Lastly, an example is
	given which shows that some of the ideas of spin glasses are applicable
	to problems outside the sphere of magnetic alloys.},

  abstract = { This paper describes a procedure that uses opaline arrays of spherical
	particles (with diameters ‚â•100 nm) as templates to fabricate porous
	membranes having three-dimensional interconnected networks of air
	balls. An aqueous dispersion of monodispersed polystyrene (or silica)
	beads was injected into a specially designed cell and assembled into
	an opaline array under external gas pressure and sonication. After
	drying, the void spaces among the spheres were filled with a liquid
	precursor such as a UV-curable (or thermally cross-linkable) prepolymer
	or a sol‚àígel solution. Subsequent solidification of the precursor
	and dissolution of the particles produced a well-defined porous membrane
	having a complex, three-dimensional architecture of air balls interconnected
	by a number of small circular ‚Äúwindows‚Äù. The porous structure
	of this kind of membrane can be easily tailored by using colloidal
	particles with different sizes:‚Äâ when spherical particles of diameter
	D are used, the dimension of air balls in the bulk is ‚àºD, the size
	of circular windows interconnecting these air balls is ‚àºD/4, and
	the diameter of circular holes on the surfaces of the membrane is
	‚àºD/2. We have demonstrated the fabrication procedure using a variety
	of materials, including a UV-curable poly(acrylate‚àímethacrylate)
	copolymer (PAMC), UV-curable polyurethanes, and sol‚àígel precursors
	to oxide ceramics such as SiO2 or TiO2. The permeabilities of these
	porous membrane films for a number of commonly used solvents were
	tested with a PAMC membrane as the example. Our measurements indicate
	that the liquid permeability of this porous membrane strongly depends
	on the properties of the liquid. In addition to their uses in filtration,
	separation, and tissue engineering, the porous membranes described
	in this paper should also find applications in fabricating diffractive
	sensors and photonic band gap (PBG) materials due to their three-dimensional
	periodic structures. },

	in a straightforward, single-step reaction. Inorganic frameworks
	composed of oxides of Si, Ti, Zr, Al, W, Fe, Sb, and a Zr/Y mixture
	were formed from metal alkoxide precursors templated around polystyrene
	(latex) spheres. Monodisperse latex spheres were ordered into close-packed
	arrays by centrifugation. The interstices between latex spheres were
	permeated by the alkoxide, which hydrolyzed and condensed. An inorganic
	framework was formed upon drying. Removal of the latex spheres was
	accomplished by either calcination at temperatures between 450 and
	1000 ¬∞C or extraction with a tetrahydrofuran/acetone mixture. The
	resulting products consisted of periodic, interconnected networks
	of monodisperse submicron pores extending over hundreds of micrometers.
	Depending on the technique of template removal, various phases of
	the inorganic oxide could be formed. For example, in the case of
	titania, an amorphous phase was formed upon extraction of TiO2 and
	anatase by calcination at 450 ¬∞C. The synthesis has also been expanded
	to other compositions including aluminophosphates and hybrid organosilicates,
	as well as silicates with bimodal distributions of meso- and macropores.
	The materials presented in this paper show the diversity of macroporous
	materials achievable with this technique. These structures could
	potentially find applications as chromatographic support materials,
	solid catalysts, battery materials, thermal insulators, or photonic
	crystals. },

	void structures is potentially valuable for many separation technologies
	as well as for emerging optical applications. This paper reports
	the preparation of macroporous polymer membranes with regular voids
	and the characterization of their diffractive optical properties.
	These materials are made using a colloidal crystal template of silica
	microspheres; the air between the spheres can be replaced by monomers
	that can be subsequently polymerized. The use of silica microspheres
	as templates makes it possible to employ chemical rather than thermal
	methods for template removal. For this reason, polymers as diverse
	as polyurethane and polystyrene can be used to create free-standing
	macroporous films, with thickness ranging from 0.5 to 50 Œºm. Scanning
	electron microscopy of these samples indicates a well-formed porous
	structure consisting of voids ranging in diameter from 200 to 400
	nm. These large cavities are not isolated, but rather interconnected
	by a network of monodisperse smaller pores (d = 50-130 nm) whose
	size can be controlled by varying the polymerization temperature.
	These membranes exhibit striking optical properties due to the periodic
	arrangement of air spheres in the polymer medium. Normal-incidence
	transmission measurements of these samples are compared to a theoretical
	model based on a scalar wave approximation. This model assumes an
	ordered structure of close-packed, three-dimensional air spheres.
	The good agreement between theory and experiment provides additional
	evidence of the long-range order of these samples.},

	applications will be more speculative, but we attempt to evaluate
	the real prospects offered by photonic crystals at optical frequencies

	a variety of areas such as the combination of quantum dot light emitters

  abstract = { This paper describes a method for the crystallization of mesoscale
	particles over areas as large as ‚àº1 cm2. We injected an aqueous
	dispersion of spherical particles into a cell formed by two glass
	substrates and a square frame of photoresist that had been patterned
	on the surface of one of the substrates. One side of the frame had
	channels on its surface that could retain the particles while letting
	the solvent flow through. External gas pressure and sonication drove
	the particles into a cubic-close-packed (ccp) assembly with the (111)
	face parallel to the surfaces of the glass substrates. The smallest
	particles that have been crystallized by this method are polystyrene
	beads of ‚àº60 nm in diameter. The procedure presented here offers
	a number of attractive features:‚Äâ (i) It is relatively fast. For
	example, polystyrene beads of 0.48 Œºm in diameter can be crystallized
	into a 25 layer assembly over an area of ‚àº1 cm2 in ‚àº48 h. (ii)
	It has a tight control over the surface morphology and the number
	of layers of the crystalline assemblies. (iii) It works for aqueous
	dispersions of a wide range of spherical particles regardless of
	their chemical compositions and/or surface properties (such as charge
	densities and chemical functional groups). We have also demonstrated
	fabrication of tunable optical filters from these crystalline assemblies
	of particles. Each crystalline assembly effectively rejects a narrow
	wavelength interval (as determined by the Bragg condition) in the
	spectral region ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared. The tunability
	(in terms of wavelength) of the filter can be achieved by changing
	the angle between the incident light and the normal to the surface
	of the filter, or by using particles with different diameters. },

  abstract = {The Becker-Kersten treatment of domain boundary movements is widely
	applicable in the interpretation of magnetization curves, but it
	does not account satisfactorily for the higher coercivities obtained,
	for example, in permanent magnet alloys. It is suggested that in
	many ferromagnetic materials there may occur 'particles' (this term
	including atomic segregates or 'islands' in alloys), distinct in
	magnetic character from the general matrix, and below the critical
	size, depending on shape, for which domain boundary formation is
	energetically possible. For such single-domain particles, change
	of magnetization can take place only by rotation of the magnetization
	vector, I$_{0}$. As the field changes continuously, the resolved
	magnetization, I$_{H}$, may change discontinuously at critical values,
	H$_{0}$, of the field. The character of the magnetization curves
	depends on the degree of magnetic anisotropy of the particle, and
	on the orientation of 'easy axes' with respect to the field. The
	magnetic anisotropy may arise from the shape of the particle, from
	magneto-crystalline effects, and from strain. A detailed quantitative
	treatment is given of the effect of shape anisotropy when the particles
	have the form of ellipsoids of revolution (section section 2,3,4),
	and a less detailed treatment for the general ellipsoidal form (section
	5). For the first it is convenient to use the non-dimensional parameter
	h, such that h = H/($|N_{a}-N_{b}|$) I$_{0}$, N$_{a}$ and N$_{b}$
	being the demagnetization coefficients along the polar and equatorial
	axes. The results are presented in tables and diagrams giving the
	variation with h of I$_{H}$/I$_{0}$. For the special limiting form
	of the oblate spheroid there is no hysteresis. For the prolate spheroid,
	as the orientation angle, $ \theta $, varies from 0 to 90 degrees,
	the cyclic magnetization curves change from a rectangular form with
	$|h_{0}|$ = 1, to a linear non-hysteretic form, with an interesting
	sequence of intermediate forms. Exact expressions are obtained for
	the dependence of h$_{0}$ and $ \theta $, and curves for random distribution
	are computed. All the numerical results are applicable when the anisotropy
	is due to longitudinal stress, when h = HI$_{0}$/3$ \lambda \sigma
	$, where $ \lambda $ is the saturation magnetostriction coefficient,
	and $ \sigma $ the stress. The results also apply to magneto-crystalline
	anisotropy in the important and representative case in which there
	is a unique axis of easy magnetization as for hexagonal cobalt. Estimates
	are made of the magnitude of the effect of the various types of anisotropy.
	For iron the maximum coercivities, for the most favourable orientation,
	due to the magneto-crystalline and strain effects are about 400 and
	600 respectively. These values are exceeded by those due to the shape
	effect in prolate spheroids if the dimensional ratio, m, is greater
	than 1 $ \cdot $1; for m = 10, the corresponding value would be about
	10,000 (section 7). A fairly precise estimate is made of the lower
	limit for the equatorial diameter of a particle in the form of a
	prolate spheroid below which boundary formation cannot occur. As
	m varies from 1 (the sphere) to 10, this varies from 1 $ \cdot $5
	to 6 $ \cdot $1 $ \times $ 10$^{-6}$ for iron, and from 6 $ \cdot
	$2 to 25 $ \times $ 10$^{-6}$ for nickel (section 6). A discussion
	is given (section 7) of the application of these results to (a) non-ferromagnetic
	metals and alloys containing ferromagnetic 'impurities', (b) powder
	magnets, (c) high coercivity alloys of the dispersion hardening type.
	In connexion with (c) the possible bearing on the effects of cooling
	in a magnetic field is indicated.},

	by adsorption of the surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide.
	The colloidal crystals are then infused with a silica solution, which
	polymerizes in the cavities. In the final stage, the latex particles
	are removed by calcination, leaving behind porous silica of very
	low density. Scanning electron microscopy images demonstrate that
	the product has highly uniform and structured pores, representing
	a negative replica of the original colloidal crystal. The size of
	the pores can be controlled by changing the size of the latex used,
	and we were able to obtain samples with pores ranging from 150 to
	1000 nm. Thus the method allows one to obtain structured silica materials
	of which the pore size, shape, and ordering can be controlled in
	a wide region that has previously been unattainable. },

	macropores in titania (TiO2), by template-assisted growth. The crystals
	were characterized by synchrotron small-angle X-ray diffraction,
	X-ray absorption, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
	microscopy, optical microscopy, optical reflectivity, and Raman spectroscopy.
	Care was taken to make well-ordered templates, by slowly growing
	colloidal crystals from lightly charged polystyrene latex particles
	and carefully drying them to form opals. Solid material was deposited
	in the opal template by precipitation from an alkoxide hydrolysis.
	Subsequently, the samples were heated to 450 ¬∞C to form anatase
	TiO2 and to remove the latex template, which resulted in a macroporous
	crystal, inverse opal, or air-sphere crystal. The macropores were
	close-packed and interconnected by windows, and small additional
	voids were located at interstices between the pores. The macropores
	were arranged on a face-centered cubic lattice with domains of more
	than 750 √ó 350 √ó 250 unit cells. The size polydispersity of the
	air spheres and mean-squared displacements from the lattice sites
	were studied for the first time. Both quantities were small, thus
	quantifying the excellent long-range order. The lattice parameter
	was shrunk by about 30% relative to the template, irrespective of
	the radii of the pores, while the long-range order persisted. The
	surfaces of the macropores appeared to be rough up to length scales
	of ‚àº10 nm, the sizes of the largest TiO2 crystallites, with a roughness
	distribution following a power law. The volume fraction of the solid
	backbone was determined for the first time in situ by X-ray absorption
	and was found to be between 5 and 12 vol % TiO2. The wavelengths
	of the optical Bragg reflections were proportional to the radii of
	the air spheres. By the use of the measured TiO2 fraction, the refractive
	index of the solid matrix was found to be 2.7 ¬± 0.4, in good agreement
	with the refractive index of massive anatase TiO2. We briefly explored
	the assembly of macropores in rutile-TiO2 and in rock salt. It was
	concluded that macroporous crystals are highly effective three-dimensional
	photonic crystals. },

	includes oxides or carbonates of many metals in the periodic table

	compositions that are less accessible or more expensive by previous

	Formation of single-crystal opal films from a suspension of monodisperse
	spherical silica particles in a dynamic meniscus area is treated
	as nanocrystallization involving interparticle interaction forces.
	Preparation of high-quality photonic-crystal films with a reflection
	coefficient in the photonic band gap up to 90% is based on the concept
	of equilibrium crystallization. In practice, this process occurs
	through the correction of oppositely directed interparticle interaction
	forces down to a quasi-equilibrium state. Two- and three-layer heterostructures
	have been produced from single-crystal films with various sizes of
	silica spheres. Well-resolved allowed ranges within photonic band
	gaps have been detected for three-layer heterostructures, suggesting
	interesting applications of photonic crystals.},
